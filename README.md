# t-ask-server

Task is a data-driven web app aiming to provide a guide for developers on how to keep updated in the IT market by comparing the trends of the most popular programming languages against their demand in the industry.

Task uses Google Trends API and GitHub API to pull realtime data and compares it with a huge dataset of job postings provided by the company LinkUp.

As a Data Analyst, I worked in the query development of the data from multiple sources into a MySQL relational database.

As a Back-end developer, I also worked in the construction of a server app using Node.js and Express to provide the query logic and endpoints, that were then served as an API REST for the Front-end team.
