Python,"Python embraces a ""there should be one—and preferably only one—obvious way to do it"" design philosophy."
Python,To say that code is pythonic is to say that it uses Python idioms well, that it is natural or shows fluency in the language.
Python,Python uses whitespace indentation, rather than curly brackets or keywords, to delimit blocks. An increase in indentation comes after certain statements; a decrease in indentation signifies the end of the current block.

C#,C# was developed around 2000 by Microsoft as part of its .NET initiative.
C#,C# was designed by Anders Hejlsberg.
C#,"C# was originally named Cool, which stood for ""C-like Object-Oriented Language""."
C#,C# used to have a mascot called Andy (named after its creator Anders Hejlsberg).
C#,"The name ""C sharp"" was inspired by the musical notation where a sharp (#) indicates that the written note should be made a semitone higher in pitch."
C#,"The sharp symbol also resembles a ligature of four ""+"" symbols (in a two-by-two grid), further implying that C# is an increment of C++."
C#,The core syntax of C# language is similar to that of other C-style languages such as C, C++, and Java.
C#,By design, C# is the programming language that most directly reflects the underlying Common Language Infrastructure (CLI).
C#,The C# language does not allow for global variables or functions. All methods and members must be declared within classes.
C#,Local variables cannot shadow variables of the enclosing block, unlike C and C++.
C#,"“Hello world” program using C#:using System; class Program {public static void Main(string[] args) {Console.WriteLine(""Hello, world!"");}}"
C#,Unlike C++, C# does not support multiple inheritances.
